    "# Taylor Series\n",

    "**[The Taylor Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series)** is useful for expressing approximations of functions when we don't know the exact function, for approximating the solutions to difficult differential equations, or when functions are too expensive (or impossible) to compute exactly. A knowledge of differential calculus is helpful, but not necessary for this notebook. The next section will briefly cover the necessary prerequisites. But first, we introduce ```sympy```, a python package that does symbolic computation, a.k.a a computer algebra system. Below we plot the two functions $y = x$ and $y = x^2$.\n",

    "## The Slope of a Nonlinear Function\n",

    "What is the slope of a function? As you may recall, it is the *rate of change* of a function. That is to say, for every increase in $x$, what is the proportional increase in $y$? The point-intercept formula of a linear function of one variable is described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "    y = mx + b\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "    m = \\frac{(y - y_0)}{(x - x_0)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above, $m$ is the ratio of the change in y by the change in x. For $y = x$, the slope is 1. For $y = 2x$, the slope is 2, and so on. But consider the function $y = x^2$. What would be its slope?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us rephrase the above equation. Let us define $f(x) = x^2$, and $h$ as an infinitesimal (a number smaller than any real number, but not zero). If we define as the slope of the tangent line at some x, we can say the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "    f'(x) =   \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "This formula describes how to find the *derivative* of a function 'from first principles'. There are many ways to describe this derivative, but for our purposes, we can define it as the *slope of the line tangent to the graph* at some $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can demonstrate this as such: Suppose $f(x) = 5x$. Then, we can say:\n",

    "\n",
    "As expected, this formula gave us the slope 5 for $f(x) = 5x$, such that $f'(x) = 5$. And this makes sense: for any value x you pass into f(x), the slope will be a constant 5 as the slope never changes.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "What an interesting result! We see that the slope is not a constant, but another function. What does this mean? It means that **for every point x, f'(x) will give you the slope of the line tangeant to the cure, also known as the instantaneous rate of change**. $f'(x)$ is referred to as the *first derivative* of $f(x)$\n",
